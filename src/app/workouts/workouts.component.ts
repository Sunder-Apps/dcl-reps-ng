          description: "It is imperative that you switch up your workouts to train each of your metabolic pathways and aerobic or anaerobic systems. For example, sprinting, one rep maxing, anything needing energy (ATP) very quickly and explosively for max power output for a short amount of time is training your PHOSPHAGEN PATHWAY, which is anaerobic. The second level is your GLYCOLITIC PATHWAY, which uses… you guessed it.. GLYCOGEN (basically, carbs / sugar) for energy. This is expressed by doing working at slightly less intensity for slightly longer, such as; a HIIT program, a bodybuilding workout, a 500 meter run.. think of this as the middle gear. Finally, a more endurance based, longer form and lower intensity cardio, such as an hour jog, row, or swim, is working your OXIDATIVE PATHWAY, which is aerobic. All 3 systems are usually all working at once, just the type of training you are doing dictates what will take over. For optimal results & cardiovascular health (especially in the wake of this virus which negatively affects these areas) it is wise to train every pathway. Which we are. You’re welcome."
