<p>If your weights or homemade <span>doomsday equipment</span> are of limited weight and variety to the point that you feel you can&rsquo;t complete the given exercise properly in the rep range given, manipulate the tempo. For example, if all you have is a 15 pound dumbbell or 10 pound jug of water to do 5 heavy single arm rows with, simply perform the five rows <span>really slow</span>, feeling your muscles <span>stretch</span> and <span>contract</span>, controlling the weight (and your breath!!) completely through the movement, until 5 reps becomes difficult... or as close as you can get to it. Conversely, speeding up the tempo to <span>rep some shit out</span> is welcome as well.</p>
