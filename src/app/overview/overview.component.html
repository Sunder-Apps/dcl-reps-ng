<h4>YOU&rsquo;RE ALL GOING TO LIFT DOWN HERE!</h4>
<p>We may not have a cure, but we have a solution. Welcome freaks, to <span>28 REPS LATER</span>&#8230; your very own at-home quarantine trainer for the duration of the current <span>zombie virus outbreak</span>. Complete with blood, weights, hazmat suits, toxic waste, ammunition, tactical combat skills, and more. Within the confines of this program you will have access to apocalypse-friendly fitness, nutrition, and mental training to equip yourself and all loved ones with essential weapons needed to survive the <span>rapture</span>&#8230; and keep your immune systems <span>FIRED UP</span>.</p>
<p>Feast your eyes upon this 4 week (28 day) all-encompassing outbreak program. In which you will see workouts easily done in the comfort of your own bunker, or outdoors if it is safe enough for you. If you are lucky enough to be within the realm of a home gym or you were a smart enough paranoid prepper to have sufficient at home workout equipment and food, then more power to you. Please proceed as necessary, with <span>brute force</span> and caution.</p>
<p>For the rest of us, however, not so ahead of our fitness goals in wake of the <span>virus outbreak</span> and suddenly found ourselves surprise quarantined with lack of workouts, weapons, and a mission; <span>DO NOT FEAR</span>. Every workout and exercise in this program has been special designed to have the capability of being performed with any household items, tools, body parts, or whatever you have laying around. Just have a space and your bodyweight if nothing else and we will get through this <span>outbreak</span> together.</p>
<p>Just as in any good <span>outbreak</span>, there are rules and guidelines one must follow in order to protect themselves as well as others from infection; these will parallel the days of this program. Each of the below steps to shrive the <span>outbreak</span> will each be a day in the program, that we will there by cycle through. These steps include:</p>
<mat-chip-list>
    <mat-chip>Kill The Infected</mat-chip>
    <mat-chip>Contain The Disease</mat-chip>
    <mat-chip>Exterminate The Waste</mat-chip>
    <mat-chip>Survive The Rapture</mat-chip>
    <mat-chip>Sabbath, The Day of Rest</mat-chip>
</mat-chip-list>
<p><span>Day 1</span> is <span>KILL</span> Day. Meaning, we&rsquo;re <span>fucking shit up</span>. <span>Kill</span> day will employ principles of MMA, boxing, gymnastics, calisthenics, &amp; functional training; primarily with bodyweight.</p>
<p><span>Day 2</span> is <span>Containment</span> Day. Traditionally meaning, contain all disease-free and infected separately to avoid spreading the virus, or killing a loved one with your <span>bare hands and teeth</span>. We are going to use it in the sense of containing your strength &amp; muscle size. This will be strength/bodybuilding day using traditional gym equipment, if you have it (and if you don&rsquo;t... we&rsquo;ll get real crazy with that in just a minute), sucks as a weight bench, bars, dumbbells, bands, and a pull up bar. <span>IF THERE IS ONE THING I SUGGEST YOU PURCHASE FOR THIS IT IS A PULLUP BAR</span>.</p>
<p><span>Day 3</span> is <span>Extermination</span> Day. Instead of <span>blowtorching</span> words of undead, we&rsquo;re <span>setting fire</span> to our fat cells. This day is all about cardio, training different cardiovascular systems throughout the plan in the form of steady state, sprints, tabata, HIIT, digging graves, plyometrics, gymnastics, and more.</p>
<p><span>Day 4</span>, after you make it through the first 3 critical phases, is simply <span>Survival</span>. Here we will be focused on primarily yoga, mobility, mediation, stretching, and light cardio to improve recovery, brain function, and working your body just enough to keep it mobile and primed for whatever the depths of the <span>apocalypse</span> can throw at it. Since activity is relatively low, we are going to keep our calories lower (which is a huge factor in maintaining proper immune function).. specifically, I recommend the <span>warrior diet</span> approach to one meal a day. We will also be providing a pro health &amp; wellness tip on these days.</p>
<p><span>Day 5</span> is the day of <span>Sabbath</span>. For all you wonderful heathens, that means rest. Although, there is no true rest day in the midst of a <span>zombie outbreak</span>, is there? We&rsquo;re going to use the 5th day as a mental health &amp; preparation day. We will meditate, read, create, and get shit done that we need to get done in order to keep or minds and body happy and healthy during this challenging time, Only <span>YOU</span> can save yourself, this will hold you accountable, This day is about mental toughness, so, we are going to be mediating. And we are going to be fasting. Yes, a complete <span>25 &mdash; 36 &mdash; 48 hour</span> (depending on you and your experience and comfort level) fast to help regulate autophagy, immune health, and repair your body from the inside out. It works! Additionally, instead of another pro tip, we are going to offer some recommended reading &amp; music on these days. Do what you will with that info, and do give us <span>YOUR</span> recommendations too. We are, in fact, all in this together, freaks!</p>
<p>We will continue cycling through this until we reach day 25, in which you will have completed 5 workouts for each day, only to finish the final 3 days with specialized <span>intense workouts</span> and a reward for surviving until <span>the end</span>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that each workout will contain all of the above elements, however, the main focus of the workout is relative to the day. So, just because it is a <span>Containment</span> day, which focuses on strength; does NOT mean there will be no cardio or flexibility training. Rather, it will just be the lesser focus. This approach to multi-system total body training over the week will keep your body <span>sharp</span> and your mind <span>tough &amp; focused</span> to handle the chaos we may be subjected to amongst the <span>zombie apocalypse</span>. We must stay prepared to fight anything that comes our way.. this training way designed with that specifically in need.</p>
