<h3 class="glitch" glitch="Goals">Goals</h3>
<p>Some of you may be caught wondering if this exact training is for you, and that as always is dependent upon your goals. But, we&rsquo;re all kinda stuck here together, so it never hurts to <span>shock your system</span> with a new training routine.. you might just learn a thing or <span>6</span>.</p>
<p>Now, if your goals is to get big as a bodybuilder, eating 7 times a day to maintain a mountain of mass.. this is definitely not for you. Furthermore if your goal is to be able to maintain your <span>666lb deadlift</span>, well this ain&rsquo;t for you either. The only good that will do is make you more appetizing to a zombie, so cut out the meat fridge. This is about staying in highly functional, strong, <span>killing-machine</span> shape.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as I know many of us our confined to our home with limited supplies of food and water, eating <span>6</span> times a day may and training for size may not be the most responsible thing to do, anyway. Use this as an opportunity to switch up your training, improve your conditioning, and survive the <span>apocalypse</span>.</p>
<p>On the contrary, if you have never trained before and this looks too advanced.. don&rsquo;t worry. There are always regressions and adjustments to be made to suit you. And nothing is cardinal law. Just because it says 50 burpees, and you know <span>damn well</span> your max ever is 10, well ya might want to scale it back a bit. BUT.. don&rsquo;t cut yourself too much slack. We know where you lift. And I see everything. It is never a bad idea to start on the path of lifting and fitness.</p>
<h4>What the hell else ya doing anyways?</h4>
<p>What you can expect from this program is to <span>GET STRONGER</span> &mdash; not in a traditional sense of squat, dead, bench, curl, well.. maybe you will. <span>BUT</span> you will be definitely getting functionally stronger and able to handle your bodyweight much more <span>efficiently</span>.</p>
<p>Mastering difficult bodyweight exercises for a high number of reps will definitely make you stronger on traditional gym lifts once you get back to it.</p>
<h4>No doubt.</h4>
<p>Im willing to bet performing muscle ups, Turkish get ups, and hill sprints to perfection will save your sweet ass from a <span>horde of flesh eating infected demons</span> way more times than a 500 pound squat will.</p>
<p>Expect your conditioning and cardio vascular health to <span>skyrocket</span>. You will loose fat, especially following a fasting/restricted calorie protocol (done correctly with enough nutrients and protein), expect to look shredded as a corpse.</p>
<h4>Only better.</h4>
<p>Training in proprioceptively rich environments (as well as <span>biohazard</span> environments) will dramatically increase awareness in your own body and movement. MMA/boxing training may not have you in Tyson Fury shape in 4 weeks, but basic fighting technique is critical to know and great for overall conditioning, coordination, and endurance. </p>
