<h3>Nutrition</h3>
<p>Now, this can be a dicey subject, especially given the current climate&#8230;and shape of our local supermarkets&#8230; if there still is any.. if anyones still alive! We are not here to tell you exactly what to eat or how to do it, given the circumstances, do what is best for you. All we can provide is this guide and this method of nutrition that I believe (as the mad scientist that constructed this program) to be the most optimal for your performance, mental clarity, and overall health. Killing machine status. So, especially given that our food choices may be limited, you know, due to the apocalypse and shit&#8230; We will do our best in this program to make our food choices non&mdash;perishable, rapture-friendly, and healthy. If you are amongst the privileged survivors that have an unlimited supply for fresh produce and/or meats; go for it. If you&rsquo;re stuck with the basics, we&rsquo;ll make it work. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re holding up a doomsday bunker and have limited supply of food, eating a traditional bodybuilding diet of 5-7 meals a day is simply non sustainable, and not optimal for fighting disease and staying healthy.. wether the contents of the meals are optimal or not. Simply eating too many calories, too frequently, is not good for your immune system function or really overall health. Since we want to be as efficient as possible with rationing our nutritional goods, fueling adequately to crush these workouts as well as any impending threat of virus or undead, and keeping our white blood cell count high and bodies running like Rambo&#8230; I recommend taking a fasting approach. The buzz word of the years (before the CV) is probably intermittent fasting, or keto, or insert fad diet here; I get it. But, as I personally have followed an IF protocol for quite a while as well as have seen success across the board with clients not only in terms of aesthetics (because of its ability to maintain and even build muscle while reducing fat), but also mental performance, mood, and autophagy. AUTOPHAGY is a word you will see used in this program quite a bit.. for good reason. &ldquo;Auto&rdquo; means self and &ldquo;Phagy&rdquo; means eat.. so you literally EAT YOUR OWN FLESH. IT&rsquo;S THE FASTEST WAY TO SEE YOUR WEIGHT LOSS GOALS REALIZED. RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES! Just kidding.. kind of. I|Autophagy is your cells cleaning out your damaged cells. Bu giving your digestive system a break, it allows for efficient autophagy to take palce. You see, digestion takes about as much energy from your body as anything, when you provide it a break from that process, your body will use its energy to repair &amp; heal its damaged or inflamed cells. Increasing immune function. One of the best things you can do to rid yourself of sickness and protect from disease is restricting calories and/or fasting. Check out the populations in the world that live the longest.. the usually eat the least. I&rsquo;m not talking shit, this is backed up research that I&rsquo;ve done more than my fair share of digging up on. And I have oversimplified that for sake of you still reading this very page, so I urge you to do a quick google search and read up on it for yourselves. Always.</p>
<p>SO, what we are going to do, at first anyways&#8230; is follow a 16 hour fast, followed by an 8 hour eating window, per day. You can do whatever works best for you in terms of times and meal frequency. Personally speaking, I find it best to stop eating 2-3 hours before bed, and wait at least 3 hours after waking to eat. Assuming you sleep 6-8 hours per night, that should afford you an 8 hour time window in the middle of the day with no problem. So if you have your first meal at 11 am, and stop eating by 7 pm, sleeping 10-6 (ideally), that&rsquo;s your fasting window. Like I said, feel free to adjust to a time that suits you best, that is best for me. This ALSO will help combat that &ldquo;sit mourned and eat because you&rsquo;re lazy and bored watching Netflix&rdquo; attitude. Cut that shit out.</p>
<p>As far as what to eat and when to eat it in your allotted 8 hours, that is going to vary based on you as an individual, what you have access to food wise, and what morals/ diet principles you have aligned yourself with. I recommend a whole food, natural approach. Fruits, veggies, eggs, nuts, seeds, and the occasional wild caught fish or grass fed meat if you have access to that. Now, since we are in the midst of an apocalypse&#8230; canned or frozen vegetables &amp; fruit will work just fine. Beans are an excellent source of carbs and protein to fuel your workouts. Any reasonably healthy soup and / or bone broth is a fantastic option for protein. From there, canned tuna, salmon, smoked oysters, all that smelly canned seafood shit is a great option as well. Eggs are my choice source though, if you have them on hand. If not, steal a chicken from your local farm as long as its not oozing at the mouth or bleeding from the eyes, you should be alright. Oatmeal or healthy cereal if you tolerate grains well (or that&rsquo;s all you have) is also apocalypse approved. In terms of fat, any and all nuts/nut butters, avocado, ghee, coconut oil, etc&#8230; all love. Fear not the fat, especially in helping keeping you satiated during your fasting time.</p>
<p>SPICE up your FREAKING life, friends. A little cayenne pepper and basil can go a long way. I am a huge believer in the anti-inflammatory and digestive health properties of ginger, turmeric, and garlic. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of the spice rack, it works black magic on those bland and weird canned goods.</p>
<p>Also, feel free to supplement with a protein powder that works for you. I personally avoid dairy but if you are good with whey then whey to go, brother. I prefer supplementing with collagen protein or bone broth protein. Additionally, since you may not be getting very much sun locked down in your iron dungeon, supplementing with Vitamin D3 would be a huge benefit to you. Additionally, a good multivitamin will act as a safety net to replace all the nutrients you may not be getting in the doomsday diet. No one is perfect, ensure a positive mineral and vitamin balance with a good multi. Probiotics and / or digestive enzymes are always recommended. BCAAS or any amino acid supplement you like will assist in recovery from the works as well as sustain your muscles during this time of slightly restricted calories due to fasting. Don&rsquo;t worry, you will not shrivel away. YET!!</p>
<p>How much should you eat when you do and when should you? Well, I like to make the first meal your post workout meal. Yes, meaning we will train in a fasted state. If you are not used to this, it may be rough at first, but I urge you to give it a try. You&rsquo;ll feel exponentially lighter, more functional, and executing the workout more efficiently than if you just housed a bowl of protein oatmeal after 16 hours of fasting. If you feel you need a little something in your system before the workout, then have a snack, like fruit or protein powder in coffee. But I URGE you YET AGAIN to experiment with fasted training, just make sure you properly hydrate. Especially if you drink as much coffee as I do. yes, black coffee and Slayer is my pre-workout supplement of choice. From there, you can eat as many more times in your window as you see fit. I just warn against eating too much, it can be easy to do. I personally will eat twice a day with a liquid (Amino Acid, or Bone Broth) snack. During this time of one or 2 whole food meals a day, especially since our activity is high, don&rsquo;t be afraid to make them hearty, filling meals. Thats alllll you get for the day so, enough protein &amp; fats is critical.</p>
<p>On our Survival and Sabbath days, however, we will be employing the Warrior Diet approach.. ONE MEAL A DAY. The terror!!! I know! Guess what.. just like the apocalypse&#8230; you&rsquo;ll survive this too. Our activity on these days is dramatically decreased, requiring less nutrition and like we talked about already, giving your digestive system a break so your body can recover itself. We will also be doing more mental-focused activities on those days, and have too much fuel in your body will only make you full and groggy. What you do eat on these days I recommend being high in fat, with some protein, and veggies. Avoid processed carbs or starches if possible. I personally like broths and smoothies for my meal on these days. ADVANCED OPTION: have a nutrient rich smoothie, salad, or scramble as your meal on Survival day.. then go for a complete fast (coffee, tea, and water only) on Sabbath Day. A 24 hour fast can work wonders for your system. In fact,, fasting experts are recommending a 24-48 fasts for cell autophagy, mitochondria health, and rationing food during this time &#8230; I think we just said something like that?? If you are brand new to fasting, I have a hard time recommending diving into a full on 24 or 48 hour fast, so give it a try only if you feel you can handle it (pssst you can, just be smart). You could even rock an all liquid diet the last two days of the week and see how that goes. I personally will be having a shake around noon on survival day, then liquid fasting (broth only if I feel I need the extra protein for recovery, but that will be rare. Trust me. I&rsquo;m a limo driver. And I&rsquo;ve done this before.) AND not eating my next meal til 11 am on the following Kill Day. Essentially a 48 hour fast.</p>
